Repository includes all code used for plots created and excel sheets of data files used for the plots. These plots include: capactive displacement measurement vs. displacement calculated from fringe count, means of all slopes for 300, 1000, and 2000 microns vs. their displacements, first capacitive sensor vs. second reference capacitive sensor, and M-E time series plots.
